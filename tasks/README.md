# Task Folder:
###### This folder is, as one might assume, for laying out parsing tasks.

### Create a Task:
To create a task, you create a folder! Or rather, you create a subfolder within the Tasks 
folder to contain the excel file you want modified and an accompanying text file describing what the output should look like.

## Github Only Instructions:
Here I'll assume that you are familiar with Git and would need instructions because you're working on Windows. 
For the moment I'll simply include a link to instructions on setting up GitHub desktop. After you have everything set 
up, the process is pretty much the same as in the example below with GitHub and Google Drive, only you'll be using the 
tasks folder that is in the project which means you can do everything within Git on your desktop instead of having to deal 
with Google Drive.

## GitHub + Google Drive Instructions:
#### Example:
Hannah decides that she hates having to track down historical sales data relationships, 
this seem like something that could be automated. Hannah navigates to the Alamance folder in a shared Google Drive
and creates a subfolder in the tasks folder. She then uploads her excel file into the  subfolder and types up a quick note 
explaining the format of data she wants. She creates an issue for the task on GitHub and assigns it to a developer. 
And that's it, she can go on about her day!

#### Links:
You will need a GitHub account and permissions for the Alamance group account in order to create issues.
While I encourage people to do this, creating a task in the Drive folder and sending an email to the developer
will suffice.
